        Cooperative Multiplayer adaptation of Singleplayer maps for Halo Custom Edition
    </p>
</html>

An adaptation and recreation of the campaign maps for Halo Combat Evolved, modified to work with
Halo Custom Edition with support for an online multiplayer gameplay experience.

# How it works?

A campaign multiplayer project is not as easy as it probably sounds, it's indeed quite easy
but requires setup and a reinvention of the campaign mechanisms to work with multiplayer.
This project has different tools that can help in the procedure of adapting campaign maps to
multiplayer:

- **Mimic** - Core of all the synchronization mechanism for multiplayer events
- **Mimic Adapter** - Script capable of rewriting the campaign HSC scripts for compatibility with multiplayer
- **Harmony SAPP** - A hook DLL provider to intercept script events for synchronization purposes via Mimic

**NOTE:** This is not a just 2 players or splitscreen coop project, this is a fully 16 players
over network project for **Halo Custom Edition 1.0.10**.

# Can I contribute/help?

Of course! We need a lot of help to achieve this project, we have a workflow designed for contributions with support for people being added into the project development as soon as possible.
You can contribute with help with testing on beta sessions or directly contributing with the map
content or code contributions.
